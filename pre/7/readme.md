Exercise 1   The goal of this exercise is to practice encapsulation with some of the examples in this chapter.

    Starting with the code in Section 8.6, write a method called powArray that takes a double array, a, and returns a new array that contains the elements of a squared. Generalize it to take a second argument and raise the elements of a to the given power.
    Starting with the code in Section 8.10, write a method called histogram that takes an int array of scores from 0 to (but not including) 100, and returns a histogram of 100 counters. Generalize it to take the number of counters as an argument.


Exercise 4   Write a method called indexOfMax that takes an array of integers and returns the index of the largest element. Can you write this method using an enhanced for loop? Why or why not?


Exercise 5   The Sieve of Eratosthenes is "a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit," which you can read about at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes.

Write a method called sieve that takes an integer parameter, n, and returns a boolean array that indicates, for each number from 0 to n - 1, whether the number is prime.
